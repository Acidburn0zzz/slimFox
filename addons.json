As such, it might stop working with any new version!\n\nBy default Stylish Sync creates daily backups of your Stylish database in your profile folder. If you find missing styles try to restore a previous version and let me know!\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n\n    Stylish Sync 0.1.7 has not been tested with Stylish 2.0.0!. I just became aware of the new version on Dec. 8. 2014, but unfortunately, my time to check on this now, is limited. If you want to provide feedback, please use the support email on the homepage. Any information is welcome. If you experience any problems, you might either disable Stylish Sync or revert to Stylish 1.4.3. Anyway it might be a good idea to use Stylish Sync's backup facility before upgrading. Update: Preliminary tests seem to indicate, that the synchronization is still working. However, with Stylish 2.0.0 you lose the ability to preview your styles and to organize them by tags.\n    With Firefox 29.0 (\"New Sync\"), the sync-options dialog has changed, and you cannot en-/disable syncing from that dialog anymore. En-/Disabling from the add-on options is still possible.\n    There was a compatibility problem with Stylish 1.4.2. New styles won't get synced to other devices. Thanks a lot for the bug report. Unfortunately, these changes make version 0.1.7 incompatible with Stylish 1.4.1 and below. If you're still using Stylish 1.4.1 or lower, please get Stylish Sync 0.1.6 from the versions page or better yet, upgrade both add-ons.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/68/68099.png?src=api&modified=1330400884","width":"700","height":"360","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/68/68099.png?src=api&modified=1330400884","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"102","caption":"Default options"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylishsync/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylishsync/?src=api","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/250582/stylish_sync-0.1.7-fx+sm.xpi?src=api","size":29049,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylishsync/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$1.99","developerComments":"Unfortunately, Stylish doesn't allow to synchronize its data with Mozilla's sync service.\n\nThis extension adds the missing functionality.","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylishsync/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":26,"totalDownloads":213713,"weeklyDownloads":284,"dailyUsers":5700,"updateDate":1395593284000,"supportURL":"https://code.google.com/p/stylishsync/wiki/README"},{"id":"uBlock0@raymondhill.net","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-32.png?modified=1482142818","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-64.png?modified=1482142818"},"name":"uBlock Origin","type":"extension","version":"1.10.4","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/gorhill/?src=api"},"description":"Finally, an efficient blocker.

It also works with most video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe and thousands others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, MP2T, F4F, … Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is also able to capture directly from the screen and generate a video file out of it.\n\nAs a bonus, Video DownloadHelper can also record Twitter Periscope. Just specify search terms and the add-on will capture over night related live streams.\n\nAs another bonus, you can also use Video DownloadHelper to capture a full browsing session, optionally highlighting the mouse position and generate a video file out of it. This is ideal to create Web a site demos as a video.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also able to make video conversion (changing audio and video formats) and aggregation (joining separate audio and video to a single file) very easy. This is a commercial feature that helps paying for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from web sites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nWhen you first install the extension, your browser is redirected to a welcome page with links to a user manual at http://www.downloadhelper.net/howto.php.\n\nThis does not change your homepage setting and the welcome page won't appear anymore.\n\nYou may want to watch this video about using Video DownloadHelper 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhqUx-b5-bE\n\nSupport can be obtained from

It prevents a lot of requests from reaching networks like Google Hosted Libraries, and serves local files to keep sites from breaking. Complements regular content blockers.","fullDescription":"Websites have increasingly begun to rely much more on large third-parties for content delivery. Canceling requests for ads or trackers is usually without issue, however blocking actual content, not unexpectedly, breaks pages. The aim of this add-on is to cut-out the middleman by providing lightning speed delivery of local (bundled) files to improve online privacy.\n\n     • Protects privacy by evading large delivery networks that claim to offer free services.\n     • Complements regular blockers such as uBlock Origin (recommended), Adblock Plus, et al.\n     • Works directly out of the box; absolutely no prior configuration required.\n\nNote: Decentraleyes is no silver bullet, but it does prevent a lot of websites from making you send these kinds of requests. Ultimately, you can make Decentraleyes block requests for any missing CDN resources, too.\n\n   > Simpler introduction: https://github.com/Synzvato/decentraleyes/wiki/Simple-Introduction\n\nAm I Currently Protected?\n\nThe following testing utility shows you if you are properly protected. It's the recommended and, probably, fastest way to see if this add-on is installed, enabled, and correctly configured.\n\n   > Full link to testing utility: https://decentraleyes.org/test\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n     • Where can I see its status, or in what way it impacts network activity?\n     • Why doesn't it deliver resources from CDNs I block using a different add-on?\n     • Can CDNs track me even though they do not place tracking cookies?\n     • My browser caches downloaded CDN libraries, doesn't that protect my privacy?\n     • What does it do to protect me when it has no choice but to allow a request?\n     • Will it work well in combination with other privacy enhancing add-ons?\n\n   > Full link to FAQ: https://github.com/Synzvato/decentraleyes/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions\n\nTechnical Information\n\n- Supported Networks: Google Hosted Libraries, Microsoft Ajax CDN, CDNJS (Cloudflare), jQuery CDN (MaxCDN), jsDelivr (MaxCDN), Yandex CDN, Baidu CDN, Sina Public Resources, and UpYun Libraries.\n\n- Bundled Resources: AngularJS, Backbone.js, Dojo, Ember.js, Ext Core, jQuery, jQuery UI, Modernizr, MooTools, Prototype, Scriptaculous, SWFObject, Underscore.js, and Web Font Loader.\n\nPersonal Support\n\nIs your question not listed above, or do you have any other reason to contact me personally?

On MacOSX tabs also get a 'reversed appearance'.\n\nApplication button / application menu settings\n\nApplication button on [Firefox] titlebar [Windows only]\nThe titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left like on Firefox since version 4.0. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication button on toolbars\nOn toolbars the button appears like a default toolbar button.\n\nApplication button colours\nOn titlebar and tabs toolbar the application button can be orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray in normal browsing mode and purple in private browsing mode like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. The 'splitmenu' will not be restored and the appmenu popup/submenus also miss some non-replicable menuitems.\n\nSmall navigation toolbar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate old 'small icon view'.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding navigation toolbar might be interesting after content got moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at the bottom of the window. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar) or using 'Ctrl + /' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd + /' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nA toolbar between navigation toolbar and bookmarks toolbar. It can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar).\n\nIcons + text / text only mode\nSimulates old icons + text / text modes where text was displayed below toolbar buttons or button icons got hidden.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nA default 'menu button' which opens the 'classic' bookmarks menu. Positioned on bookmarks toolbar the button also displays its label.\n\nBookmarks and history sidebar buttons\nButtons which toggle bookmarks and history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTR adds duplicates of these buttons to the customization palette.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace reload button AFTER stop button and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hovering the option on preference window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces, flexible spaces and separators\nThese toolbar items appear in customizing mode and can be moved to toolbars like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8(.1) & 10 & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9/10.10/10.11. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nInfo, known 'issues', 'glitches', problems\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox resolves the problem. This glitch is caused by Microsoft Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Entering and leaving customizing mode 'disables' right-click menu items for bookmarks inside bookmarks menu button. A restart resolves this issue.\n4) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using Firefox 28 colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n5) It is strongly recommended to remove Foxtab and Shareaholic before installing Firefox 29 or newer, because both add-ons break Firefox ui in Fx29+. Using Foxtab and/or Shareaholic with CTR causes even more errors, because CTR allows to move/remove more items than the default Firefox does.\nIf one of these add-ons has corrupted the ui, the add-ons manager has to be accessed via menubar (right-click on a toolbar -> select menubar, Tools -> add-ons) and Shareaholic and Foxtab have to be uninstalled and CTR has to be disabled. After a browser restart, CTR can be enabled again. After another restart \"restore defaults\" in customizing mode has to be hit once.\n\n##############################################\n\nIt is recommended to switch to a clean new profile or at least to trigger \"Restore Defaults\" in customizing mode to avoid UI issues after upgrading from Firefox 28 (and older) to Firefox 29 (and newer).\nProfile Switcher add-on and Profilist add-on can help creating new profiles.\n\n##############################################\n\nAVAST AV software,\"Browser Cleanup\" and disappearing Firefox add-ons\nIf Avasts \"Browser Cleanup\" still accidentally removes Firefox add-ons consider removing or disabling \"Browser Cleanup\" feature.\n\n##############################################\n\ngHacks.net article (10 Reasons why you may want to try

Report a fake location with the addition of random noise in order to protect your privacy. Per site settings with three configurable levels of accuracy or even the possibility to use a fixed location.","fullDescription":"Modern browsers such as Mozilla Firefox can tell websites where you're located in order to provide location-aware functionality. Your geographic location is obtained through various means (eg. using wifi data) and is often highly accurate, which can be a violation of your privacy.\n\nThis extension allows you to enjoy the useful applications of geolocation while protecting your privacy. It does so by reporting a fake location to websites, obtained by adding a certain amount of \"noise\" to the real location. The noise is randomly selected in a way that ensures that the real location cannot be inferred with high accuracy.\n\nThree configurable privacy levels are provided. The higher the privacy level the greater the amount of noise, which gives better privacy at the expense of a less accurate fake location. This can be configured per-website for flexibility: a more accurate location can be provided for driving directions than for a weather forecast. There's also an option to use a fixed location, instead of adding noise to the real one. This offers the best privacy (no dependence on the real location at all), at the cost of very low accuracy.\n\nNote: your location can be also detected from your IP address, but usually with poor accuracy. Location Guard protects the accurate location revealed through the javascript API.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152196.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152196.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Location guard in use on openstreetmap.org"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152198.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152198.png?src=api&modified=1422927979","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Privacy levels configuration."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152264.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","width":"364","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152264.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","thumbnailWidth":"104","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Location Guard on Android."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152266.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","width":"367","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152266.png?src=api&modified=1422927980","thumbnailWidth":"105","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Options page on Android."}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/419849/location_guard-1.2.3-fx+an.xpi?src=api","size":295175,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":35,"totalDownloads":437606,"weeklyDownloads":1114,"dailyUsers":25969,"updateDate":1459524460000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard/issues"},{"id":"{77d2ed30-4cd2-11e0-b8af-0800200c9a66}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/295/295337-32.png?modified=1480990819","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/295/295337-64.png?modified=1480990819"},"name":"FT DeepDark","type":"theme","version":"14.2.4","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"steva","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/steva/?src=api"},"description":"Smooth dark theme for Firefox\n> Beta version available on the FT DeepDark's \"version history\" page","fullDescription":"\"FT DeepDark\" is a theme which has been created to transform the look of Firefox for Windows users. It has been specially designed for Windows 7 (with Aero Style enabled), but it can also be installed on other Windows versions and Linux (just be aware that some things may look different due to differences between platforms). It does NOT officially support Aurora/Firefox Developer Edition, Nightly and any Firefox forked versions (such as Palemoon, Cyberfox, Waterfox, etc.). It is not officially available for MAC, because I can't offer support for this platform in case of issues.\nIt contains no added functionalities, it's simply a full Firefox's GUI aesthetic customization.\n\n• Userstyles to customize a bit more your FT Deepdark (such as : dark \"about:home\", \"aero style\" for tabs and tab bar background, translucent scrollbars, darker url bar background, ...) are available at userstyles.org\n• IMPORTANT ! To use these \"userstyles\" you need first to install an add-on called \"Stylish\"\n\n• FT DEEPDARK 14.2.4 available on the FT DeepDark's \"version history\" page\n\n• WHAT TO DO WHEN FACING AN ISSUE WITH FT DEEPDARK ?\n\n1) before reporting it, first try to see if the issue is due to the theme itself. How ? Enable the default theme and check if the issue is still there. If not, enable again the FT theme, but disable all other installed addons to check if the issue can be due to a conflict between addons.\n\n2) If the issue is still there after disabling all other addons and if the default theme doesn t have that issue, try to download and install again the theme (check also if you have the latest version installed, maybe the bug you want to report has already been solved with the latest updates).\n\n3) if after trying what mentioned above the problem is linked with the use of the FT theme, please, send me an e-mail (there is a link on the add-ons page to contact me) instead of reporting the bug in the add-on's review section. When sending an e-mail to report a bug, do not forget to tell me which operating system (Windows XP, 7, Vista, Linux, etc.) you are running on your computer, which version of Firefox and FT theme you are using and if you have any operating system custom theme (it can also be a cause of the issue). Then, describe the most precisely you can the issue you are facing and, if possible, please, join a screenshot and/or a short video so I could see exactly how it looks (English is not my mother tongue, so a picture can avoid the language problems). All that will help me to understand better what is the problem and to solve it quicker if possible.\nI can t promise you that I ll manage to fix every problems and also in short time, but I ll do my best for it. I m working on my themes during my free time so it can take a bit time before fixing the issues (you need also to be conscious that any updates need to be checked by Mozilla first, but if you want to have the updates a bit quicker you can follow me on Twitter and know immediately when a new version is available for download).","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":"Free for non-commercial personal use.
