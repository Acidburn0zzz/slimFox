We designed it to get you to the best things on the Web faster,  by adding search suggestions and site recommendations into Awesome Bar results. We  think it did that. We also learned a lot in the process. That’s why we’re calling  Universal Search a success.</p> <p>Our basic question was “Would Firefox users find enough value in the recommended  sites to click on them in the Awesome Bar?” and we tested this and gathered feedback  in a few ways during the course of the experiment.</p> <p><strong>Here’s how it went down</strong></p> <p>At launch, we showed participants two types of recommendations based on their  queries: top-level domains (such as Facebook.com, Amazon.com, Youtube.com, etc),  and Wikipedia article pages.</p> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/experiments_experimentdetail/6/d/6d0ff50eff9223f0d0cc58c5aa5d0c81_image_1462827811_0995.2389d5e5.jpg\" alt=\"universal search preview\" /> <figcaption>Result displaying top-level domain.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/experiments_experimentdetail/8/6/8675c7bf31054abdaf58b47850a1365d_image_1462827811_0451.9d3e091f.jpg\" alt=\"universal search preview\" /> <figcaption>Result displaying Wikipedia article.</figcaption> </figure> <p>For the first two months, we showed recommendations when we thought they  would be relevant, about 20 percent of the time. During this period, we saw  that participants clicked on a displayed result about 10 percent of the time  (we call this a click-thru rate, or CTR).</p> <p>In July, we changed the experiment so that we didn’t display a recommendation  if the site was already in a participant’s browsing history.  We expected  this to dramatically reduce the frequency of results shown, and it did.  Results displayed fell from 20 percent to 7 percent. We were surprised to see  that our CTR fell, too.  From this, we hypothesized that duplicates we removed  included many sites that users visit habitually, so our initial CTR included many  clicks “stolen” from history navigation.</p> <p>In October 2016, we added a third result type, rich movie cards. We predicted  these would have a higher CTR than the other types, but discovered that while  rich movie cards outperformed Wikipedia, they did not outperform top-level domains.</p> <p><strong>Here’s what we learned</strong></p> <p>When we evaluate an experiment we look at usage data as well as what  participants tell us in post-experiment surveys. By both measures, Universal Search  was a success. In fact, it outperformed our expectations. We had surprisingly  high CTR for showing only three result types and overall user sentiment was quite positive.</p> <p><strong>Results from telemetry data</strong></p> <p>The data showed a final average CTR of 7 percent, and indicated a clear preference  for top-level domain results. A breakdown of clicks by result type showed that  Wikipedia pages were shown most and clicked least. Top-level domains were the  most consistent performer: our better relevancy on top-level domains (even  after de-duping) probably indicated we were short-cutting users to sites  they already knew they wanted to visit. Movie Cards had the least amount of test data,  but outperformed Wikipedia pages.</p> <p>Search Results Displayed and Clicked</p> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph1.c9f9118a.png\" alt=\"Search Results Displayed and Clicked\" /> <figcaption> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph1_key1.575c4bff.png\" alt=\"Displayed\" /> Displayed<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph1_key2.1b8cb70c.png\" alt=\"Clicked\" /> Clicked<br /><br /> User data showing percentage of time recommendations were displayed and  percentage of time participants clicked on recommendations. </figcaption> </figure> <p>Key events to note in the graph</p> <ul><li>May to July -  Top-level domain and Wikipedia results displayed </li> <li>Mid-July to Mid-August - No data collected during telemetry system upgrade</li> <li>Mid-August to September - Top-level domain (de-duped) and Wikipedia results displayed</li> <li>October to November - Rich movie card, top-level domain (de-duped) and Wikipedia results displayed</li></ul> <p>Weekly Performance by Result Type</p> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2.7dbc7632.png\" alt=\"Weekly Performance by Result Type\" /> <figcaption> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key1.77d03538.png\" alt=\"Top-Level Domains: Displayed\" /> Top-Level Domains: Displayed<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key2.2106a2cf.png\" alt=\"Top-Level Domains: Clicked\" /> Top-Level Domains: Clicked<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key3.0119b83f.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia: Displayed\" /> Wikipedia: Displayed<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key4.ad3b10c1.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia: Clicked\" /> Wikipedia: Clicked<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key5.d5bec118.png\" alt=\"Movie Cards: Displayed\" /> Movie Cards: Displayed<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key6.56018cc1.png\" alt=\"Movie Cards: Clicked\" /> Movie Cards: Clicked<br /><br /> Percentage of results displayed and clicked by type. </figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Results from participant feedback</strong></p> <p>The great thing about collecting feedback from participants is that we can learn  as much from our failures as our successes, and even a successful experiment is  not successful for everyone.</p> <p>Some participants who left the experiment in the first weeks mentioned performance  issues. Others told us they preferred separate search and Awesome Bars: their learned  habits were hard to overcome. Many who left also cited poor result quality: search  isn’t easy to get right, especially with a limited data set.</p> <p>However, some of the most telling, representative survey feedback came from users  who stayed. Universal Search had a high retention rate, and of the users who remained:</p> <ul><li>65% agreed that Universal Search results were meaningful, and</li> <li>60% agreed that Universal Search helped them complete tasks faster.</li></ul> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph3.225bd574.png\" alt=\"Results from participant feedback\" /> <figcaption>Participant feedback survey results.</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Here’s what happens next</strong></p> <p>What’s next for Universal Search? Now that we’ve announced retirement plans  for this add-on, we will no longer maintain it.  If you have Universal Search enabled,  you don’t need to do anything. We’ll automatically uninstall it in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The experiment we built was not a complete product experience, but it was  enough to meet our learning goals. If we tried a similar experiment again, we’d  pursue better result relevancy and more diverse result types. We would also likely  test alternate UX treatments to see if we could affect interaction with results, or  improve user acceptance of the combined Awesome Bar for those users who preferred  separate URL and search bars. These are questions we may examine in future experiments.</p> <p>Thank you to all the Test Pilots who installed Universal Search, used it, and told  us what they thought!
